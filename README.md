# Hackaton_2022
Hackaton on the event 'Talent Land' on Guadalajara, that competition it was about the SARS/COVID-19.
During the event, I acted as a data specialist, responsible for ensuring that the database was cleaned and filtered, and that relevant data was extracted from specific regions using data analysis tools like Pandas and Numpy. I also used Geopandas to generate visually appealing and accurate maps that displayed the collected data in a clear and understandable way for all attendees.
It should be mentioned that it was my first time doing this outside of an exercise provided by a course, so I made several mistakes, and I am aware that my implementations might not have been appropriate. However, I have improved since then.
